In this study I used one of the most popular visuals, the radar chart, to analyze the passing quality of two players in the final match of the 2023 Women's World Cup. The players are Bonmati and Putellas, the last two players to receive Ballondor. I used the mplsoccer library for the visualization and the statsbombpy library for the data. I added McKay Jones' name in the image to give credit to him, who was a great help to me when I started this project.
