Our aim in this Hackatron was to choose one of the Premier League teams and transfer two different players for 60 million Euros.
To do this, I made a detailed analysis of the team's previous situation, its strengths and weaknesses, the player list and the two players we selected.
While doing this, I performed data visualization and analysis using the Python programming language.
